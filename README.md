This is a brief introduction on how to work with JoTyMo.

You need to first preprocess the images. You can take these images either from the Sapiens PartNet-Mobility dataset or you can ask TaarLab to share the images with you.

There are two types of preprocess, one being the preprocess for joint classification and other being for joint movement detection. Both these are needed before training the networks.

After preprocessing is done, simply have a network be trained on the data. You can train from the scratch using CNN_classify and CNN_movement, or you can load the .h or .keras files and use JoTyMo weights a preprocessor for your own system. Other files were written for the paper and are for testing or visualization of the results and don't have any type of commercial usage.

If you have any questions, ask me here on GitHub and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
